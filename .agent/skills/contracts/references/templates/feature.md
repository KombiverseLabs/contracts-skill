# [Feature Name]

## Purpose
<!-- What user problem does this solve? Not: what does it export. -->
[1-3 sentences: the user-facing value this module provides]

## Core Features
<!-- Each feature should map to a test -->
- [ ] Feature 1: [Description] → Test: [file or "TODO"]
- [ ] Feature 2: [Description] → Test: [file or "TODO"]

## Constraints
- MUST: [Testable requirement with measurable criterion]
- MUST NOT: [Anti-pattern that would cause test failure]

## Success Criteria
<!-- Each criterion = a test scenario. Be specific. -->
<!-- GOOD: "Given invalid token, when accessing /api, then returns 401 within 50ms" -->
<!-- BAD: "Module works correctly" (untestable) -->
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected outcome]
- [ ] [Metric]: [target value]

## Acceptance Tests
<!-- Define BEFORE implementation. These become your test cases. -->
- [ ] Test: [scenario] - [expected behavior]
- [ ] Test: [edge case] - [expected handling]
